# Data Analysis Repository

Welcome to the 'data-analysis' repository, where you'll find various data analysis projects. Each project is organized into its respective folder, making it easy to explore and understand the analyses conducted.

## Projects

### Project 1: [Titanic]
- **Folder:** [Titanic Data Analysis ](https://github.com/jigsaw1313/data-analysis/tree/master/titanic)
- **Description:** data analysis process such as data cleaning , data reduction and transformation and some basic visualization

### Project 2: [Red-Wine]
- **Folder:** [Red-wine Quality](https://github.com/jigsaw1313/data-analysis/tree/master/wine%20quality)  
- **Description:** This project analyzes a dataset of red wine quality. It aims to provide insights into the factors influencing wine quality. 

### Project 3: [Weather Analysis]
- **Folder:** [Weather Conditions](https://github.com/jigsaw1313/data-analysis/tree/master/weather%20dataset)  
- **Description:** This repository contains the code and analysis for the exploration of the Weather Dataset, a comprehensive time-series dataset providing per-hour information about weather conditions at a particular location. The dataset includes various parameters such as temperature, dew point, relative humidity, wind speed, visibility, pressure, and weather conditions.
